This project is a dataset generator for encrypted network traffic (both malicious and normal) that was created as part of a master thesis in 2023.
It can generate datasets and then train AI-models on those datasets.

To fully understand the code it is recommended to read the report [thesis.pdf](./thesis.pdf)
and the [User Guide](./user_guide.md).
